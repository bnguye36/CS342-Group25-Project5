Draft of the final project documentation

Section 1 - Purpose of this project
The project is for CS 342. We are to create a network game of at least 4 players.
The basic principle of the game is to guess three scrambled words in less than 2 mintues.
The first player to win three rounds wins the game!

Section 2 - High level entities 

1) The Words are obtain from a dictionary file that we made. We designed it in a way
where we keep track of which words we use so that we use all the words in the dictionary file.
If we need more words than there are available, then we start over over. Getting the words from the dictionary file is 
random. Once a word has been obtain it is scrambled and ready to be used in game.

2) Client side:
  - GUI: Gui is similiar to how we did project 3 where we have to input the IP address and port to get a connection. 
         Basic buttons will be implemented where we have a drop down menu instead of typing it in to save more time.
         Will have a cool background image.
      

Section 3 - Low level design 

Class Instructions: Class that contains the instructions for the game
  - Functions: instructions()
  * Importance: displays instructions to people who want to play 

Class Game: Class that contains the important stuff for the game. Functions and data members that help
create the three words that will be used for each round. 
  - Class Words: A inner class that will do all the work to get the three words for the game
    - Function: setWordsUsed()
      * Importance: sets the words to false for each line to say we did not use the word yet
    - Function: allowDuplicates()
      * Importance: allows the game to use duplicates when we don't have enough words left in the dictionary file
    - Function: getFromFile()
      * Importance: gets words from the file
    - Function: clearWords()
      * Importance: clears words for each round
    - Function: Shuffle()
      * Importance: shuffles/scrambles word
