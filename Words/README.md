I think have finished both of the items below: final dictionary file and the code that scrambles. Everything that 
deals with the words should be finished. I will upload the final things soon.

Update: Everything is uploaded

The code for grabbing from the text file is done and completed. It should work for multiple rounds now. 
Duplication is not allowed unless we run out of words in the file.
The only thing that needs to be finished for this is 1) Using the real dictionary file we want to use for the project 2) Making 
each string scrambled. I will be working on #2.

Currently, this folder contains the code to get three words from a text file that can be used for each round. 
It might work for multiple rounds using different words each time, but I didn't test the code for bugs. 

This is only a short summary, there might be some code I have done, but don't explain here.
I will document this in the documentation soon.
The sample txt file needs to be used to run this program. This is NOT going to be our dictionary.
More to come...

Update: txt file must be outside of the src to run the program
