Currently, this folder contains the code to get three words from a text file that can be used for each round. 
It might work for multiple rounds using different words each time, but I didn't test the code for bugs. 

This is only a short summary, there might be some code I have done, but don't explain here.
I will document this in the documentation soon.
The sample txt file needs to be used to run this program. This is NOT going to be our dictionary.
More to come...
